# Twilio SMS OTP Integration for LaraClassifier

This document describes the implementation of Twilio SMS OTP verification in the LaraClassifier login flow.

## Overview

The integration adds Twilio SMS OTP verification to the existing authentication system without modifying the UI/UX or existing view styles. Users can now log in with email or phone, and if their phone number is not verified, they will receive an OTP via SMS and be redirected to the verification page.

## Configuration

Add the following variables to your `.env` file:

```env
DISABLE_USERNAME=true
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=your_account_sid
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_auth_token
TWILIO_VERIFY_SERVICE_SID=your_verify_service_sid
```

## Features Implemented

### 1. Twilio Verify API Integration
- **File**: `app/Services/TwilioVerifyService.php`
- **Purpose**: Handles Twilio Verify API calls for sending and verifying OTP codes
- **Features**:
  - Automatic detection if Twilio Verify is configured
  - Send verification codes via SMS
  - Verify submitted codes
  - Graceful error handling

### 2. Enhanced Phone Verification
- **File**: `app/Services/Auth/Traits/Custom/Verification/PhoneVerificationTrait.php`
- **Changes**:
  - Priority use of Twilio Verify API when available
  - Fallback to regular SMS notifications when Verify API is not configured
  - Maintains existing token-based verification as backup

### 3. Login Flow Integration
- **File**: `app/Http/Controllers/Web/Auth/LoginController.php`
- **Changes**:
  - Detects when login fails due to unverified phone
  - Stores verification data in session
  - Redirects to phone verification page (`/verify/users/phone`)
  - Supports both email and phone verification redirects

### 4. Verification Process Enhancement
- **File**: `app/Http/Controllers/Web/Auth/Traits/Custom/VerifyCode.php`
- **Changes**:
  - Attempts standard token verification first
  - Falls back to Twilio Verify API for phone verification
  - Handles both verification methods seamlessly
  - Maintains existing auto-login functionality

### 5. Configuration Updates
- **Files**: 
  - `.env.example` - Added Twilio configuration variables
  - `config/twilio-notification-channel.php` - Added Verify Service SID support

## Login Flow

### Standard Flow (Phone Verified)
1. User enters email/phone + password
2. System authenticates successfully
3. User is logged in normally

### OTP Verification Flow (Phone Unverified)
1. User enters email/phone + password
2. System authenticates user but detects unverified phone
3. System sends OTP via Twilio Verify API or SMS
4. User is redirected to `/verify/users/phone`
5. User enters OTP code
6. System verifies code via Twilio Verify API or token matching
7. Phone is marked as verified
8. User is automatically logged in

## Technical Details

### SMS Sending Priority
1. **Twilio Verify API** (when `TWILIO_VERIFY_SERVICE_SID` is configured and `settings.sms.driver` = 'twilio')
2. **Regular SMS Notification** (fallback via `VerifyPhoneCode` notification)

### Code Verification Priority
1. **Database Token Matching** (existing method)
2. **Twilio Verify API** (when token doesn't match and Twilio Verify is available)

### Session Management
- Verification data is stored in session for form display
- Field values are masked for security (e.g., `+123****7890`)
- Session data is cleared after successful verification

## Security Features

- OTP codes expire automatically (configurable)
- Rate limiting on OTP requests
- Account lockout after excessive attempts
- Masked phone numbers in UI
- Secure session handling

## Backward Compatibility

- Existing email verification continues to work unchanged
- Token-based verification remains as fallback
- No changes to existing database schema required
- All existing views and styles are preserved

## Error Handling

- Graceful degradation when Twilio Verify API is unavailable
- Comprehensive error messages for users
- Detailed logging for administrators
- Fallback to regular SMS when API calls fail

## Testing

The integration includes test files to verify functionality:
- `/tmp/test_twilio_integration.php` - Tests service instantiation and configuration
- `/tmp/test_login_flow.php` - Tests login flow logic and scenarios

## Files Modified

### Core Files
1. `app/Services/TwilioVerifyService.php` - **NEW** - Twilio Verify API service
2. `app/Http/Controllers/Web/Auth/LoginController.php` - Enhanced login flow
3. `app/Http/Controllers/Web/Auth/Traits/Custom/VerifyCode.php` - Enhanced verification
4. `app/Services/Auth/Traits/Custom/Verification/PhoneVerificationTrait.php` - Enhanced SMS sending

### Configuration Files  
1. `.env.example` - Added Twilio configuration
2. `config/twilio-notification-channel.php` - Added Verify Service SID

## Usage

Once configured, the system works automatically:

1. Set up your Twilio account and Verify service
2. Configure the environment variables
3. Users logging in with unverified phones will automatically receive OTP codes
4. The existing UI handles the verification process seamlessly

## Notes

- Username login is disabled (`DISABLE_USERNAME=true`)
- The system supports both email and phone as authentication fields
- All changes are minimal and surgical to preserve existing functionality
- Views and styles remain unchanged as requested
